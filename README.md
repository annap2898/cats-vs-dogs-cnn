\# Cats vs Dogs â€“ Convolutional Neural Network



A deep learning project for binary image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with \*\*TensorFlow\*\* and \*\*Keras\*\*.



---



\## Overview

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a CNN model trained on the popular \*\*Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset\*\*.  

It demonstrates image preprocessing, data augmentation, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

\## Model \& Methodology

\- \*\*Architecture:\*\* Sequential CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, Dropout, and BatchNormalization layers.  

\- \*\*Optimizer:\*\* Adam with learning rate reduction on plateau.  

\- \*\*Callbacks:\*\* EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and ModelCheckpoint for stable and efficient training.  

\- \*\*Data Processing:\*\* ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation and normalization.
